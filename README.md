# Dots-Spline
This project aims to add editor friendly splines utilising Unity's DOTs technology.

How to install
------------

1. Go to the Package manager
2. Hit the little plus at the top left of the window
3. Add package from Git URL
4. Fill in the text as "https://github.com/crener/Dots-Spline.git#Release" for latest release package
5. Press "Add" and wait

Note: Unity will **NOT** update the package automatically as fixes and changes are made so you'll have to re-enter the git URL each time you want to update (No need to remove and add the package just pasting the URL will search and update)!
